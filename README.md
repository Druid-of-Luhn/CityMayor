## Aim of the Game

The aim of the game is to build a large and beautiful city, full of people and generating a good income. If the population does not have jobs, shops or entertainment, they will begin to leave. A lack of housing will restrict population growth.

The game is not well balanced, so once income is steady it becomes very difficult to stop it from continuing to grow. As the main point is to enjoy the calm city-building process however, this is not too much of a problem.

## Controls

The game is both keyboard- and mouse-driven and the controls are explained in game screen.
